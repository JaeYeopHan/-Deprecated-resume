### :watermelon: Project

#### octodirect - chrome extension

- Chrome web store link: (http://bit.ly/2wL9Iwv)
- GitHub repository link : (https://github.com/JaeYeopHan/octodirect)
- React, TypeScript, Redux, Redux-saga

It is a chrome extension that allows you to curate the GitHub repository you created or managed, you visited before, you clicked the star, and go directly through the shortcut. 

Opening the extension through the shortcut key brings up a list of repositories from multiple sources and shows them. Once you enter the name of the repository, you can easily get links to the repository by filtering it, and you can even go straight to the Enter key.

Versioning and distribution of Chrome extensions is cumbersome. So I am using my own deployment script. This script can be found in 'scripts / deploy.js' in this repository.

### :eggplant: Presentation

#### GDG Campus 2018.02 Meetup (Korean) - Developers who want to work together

> https://speakerdeck.com/jaeyeophan/gdg-campus-2018-meetup-balpyojaryo-hamgge-ilhago-sipeun-gaebalja

Introduce "development" that I learned in the field. I define 'coding' to be narrower and share what I felt that 'coding is only part of the process of developing something.' If possible, I will talk about the direction to move towards 'the developer we want to work with' based on this content.

#### GDG Devfest Seoul 2018 - Web Front-End performance with Chrome Devtools

> https://slides.com/jbee/devfest_seoul_2018_performance_optimization_with_chrome_devtools

There are two major areas of measurement and improvement associated with Web front-end performance. We've compiled some of the elements that can be used to measure and improve the performance of your web application by using the audits included in Chrome developer tools.
